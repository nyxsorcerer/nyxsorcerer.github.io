Enjoying fiction stories has been my hobby since childhood. From watching anime, reading light novels, web novels, and JP/KR/CN comics. I even read all the short stories in all my schoolbooks from elementary until high school in my free time.

During my college (now), I rarely read fiction stories anymore. Until I discover manhwa [Answer me, My Prince!](https://webtoons.com/en/romance/answer-me-my-prince/list?title_no=4672). This manhwa totally gave me motivation once again, and starting to read a lot of stories again.

The story is about Cordelia Grey (Main Character) working at a publisher company. Her favorite book is an old story titled **Princess and Knight** that has been already published 20 years ago. It's a popular book, but it ended with a cliffhanger. So, She eagerly tried to contact the author and asked to create a sequel of the story to publish it.

During her visit to the author's house to receive the manuscript of sequel, She met with the _proxy_ of the author, and also, she was also given an antique book chest. The book chest is actually a time machine and connected to the book chest in the past. After discovering it, she exchanges words, books, and a life story with the owner of the book chest in the past.

During their exchange of book opinion, I was so mesmerized by it. So, I am going to the local bookstore, and curious about how good is the book that they’re talks. Unfortunately, they didn’t sell it and I just picked a book according to their synopsis.

The book that I bought was **Hamlet** and **Macbeth** by William Shakespeare. I felt so stupid while reading these books, there are so many [Figures of Speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_speech) in the book and English isn’t my first language, I was overwhelmed and felt dejected. I was wondering if I am the only person who thinks like that.

So, I decided to buy the book again and put it back on the shelf hoping I would read it again. I bought two books again, **The Great Gatsby** and **To Kill a Mockingbird**.

I decided to read **The Great Gatsby** first, and totally hooked on the story. An unrequited love romance, the unexpected event in the end, and I really can relate with **Gatsby** and **Nick's** characters.

By the way, my decision to choose book is based on this [4Chan /lit/ Wiki](https://4chanlit.fandom.com/wiki/Charts).
