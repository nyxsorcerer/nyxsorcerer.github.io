Chapter 1.
- Dostoyevsky has an interesting way to introduce the narrator, he told himself is typical an hard-headed old man
- “It was not only that I could not become spiteful, I did not know how to become anything; neither spiteful nor kind, neither a rascal nor an honest man, neither a hero nor an insect.”
