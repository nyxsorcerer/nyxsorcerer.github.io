*I forgot to take a note in chapter 1-8....*

Chapter 9. (About a fight between Scout and Francis). 
- Scout tell Uncle Jack that he didn't understand children. He's not listening between two side. He realize and feel bad. Told Atticus about it and get a good sermon about parenting. 
- Bad language is a stage of children. It's better to tell the truth rather than being evasive. It's only muddled their curiosity. A children will let it passing by at the time if they're already learn the truth and not interested with it.

Chapter 10. 
- When Atticus gives Jem and Scout air-rifles, he wasn't interested in gun and not teach them. One day, He said, "I'd rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard, but i know you'll go after birds. Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird"

Chapter 11, 
- Mrs. Dubose is someone who is always cursing at children, giving sermon, and a typical annoying old ladies. Jem is being punished because he making a mess with her garden. He reads a book for Mrs. Dubose every afternoon, without Jem realizing, the time spent between them is increasing.
- After the incident with Mrs. Dubose, Scout tell to Atticus the reason of the conflict between Mrs. Dubose and Jem.
- Atticus was another victim of social because he's defending a nigger. He told to Scout this. "Before I can live with other folks, I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience".
- There's a reason why Atticus agree with the punishment. Atticus want to teach Jem and Scout to know what is the real courage. After the dead of Mrs. Dubose, Atticus said this, "... I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do".

# Part 2

Chapter 12,
- After the dead of Mrs. Dubose, Jem is getting grown up.
- Scout learn the case of Tom Robinson, but she still don't understand.
- The question given to Calpurnia actually caught me off-guard. Calpurnia talks with her folks using different accent, and Scout ask her, "Why do you talk nigger-talk to the-- to your folks when you know it's not right". Calpurnia answer, "Well, in the first place, I’m black–"  ...., Scout ask again, "But Cal, you know better". Calpurnia answer it again, "... folks don’t like to have somebody around knowin’ more than they do. It aggravates ’em. You’re not going to change any of them by talkin’ right, they’ve got to want to learn themselves, and when they don’t want to learn there’s nothing you can do but keep your mouth shut or talk their language."
